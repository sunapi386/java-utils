Latency Measurement Tool
==========================================
To periodically measure the latency of
accessing multiple hostnames and chart them visually.

The program must:

  1. Continuously and in parallel establish connections on port 80
     to two hostnames: google.com and yahoo.com.

  2. Display the latency over time of each hostname on the same
     line graph.

  3. Not block the UI when establishing connections.

Bonus points for a solution that pays attention to the presentation
of the data (line chart layout, re-scaling, axis, etc.).

We have provided a very simple starting program "LatencyTool.java"
which displays axes for plots of latency to yahoo.com and google.com,
but does not perform any measurement. It can be compiled an run using:

    javac *.java
    java LatencyChallenge

You should extend and change the code as needed to complete your program.

We're using the Swing library to create a window, but extensive knowledge
of Swing particulars is not required. Any UI using only 2D drawing
routines is sufficient.
